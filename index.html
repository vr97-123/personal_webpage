      <main>
      <p>I am a highly motivated Software Engineering enthusiast, driven by a desire to leverage technology to enhance
        systems and improve people's lives. I have acquired extensive Software Engineering skills by completing a bootcamp
        program, where I worked with Python and SQL to design applications while also refining my ability to manage my
        time and workload efficiently. My current activity, as a senior demolition project manager, I apply my
        proficiency in data and tech stack to manage all aspects of demolition projects from planning to implementation,
        ensuring successful project delivery. I continue to focus on leading cross-functional teams to complete complex
        projects on schedule and under budget. I have an unwavering commitment to continuous improvement in both system
        and service delivery, as well as in my personal development.</p>

      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <p><b>Software Engineering Bootcamp • </b> <i>HyperionDev, London <a class="date"> 2022 - Present </a></i></p>
      <p>During the bootcamp, I gained valuable experience in programming by learning the fundamentals of Python, SQL,
        HTML and CSS. This training provided me with a solid understanding of coding structure and basic concepts of
        software engineering. </p>
      <p>In addition, I was able to attend weekly lectures with experienced mentors who provided in-depth explanations
        of complex coding concepts and their practical applications. To further enhance my knowledge and skills, I
        actively worked on creating a robust portfolio during the bootcamp, which is available for review on my
        GitHub page. This portfolio showcases the practical applications of the coding skills I acquired throughout
        the program and includes a diverse range of projects that I worked on, including web development, NLP, OOP,
        data analysis, and machine learning. </p>
      <p>Overall, the bootcamp was a highly rewarding experience that allowed me to expand my knowledge and improve my
        programming skills. I am excited to continue building on this foundation and taking on new challenges in the
        field of programming. </p>
